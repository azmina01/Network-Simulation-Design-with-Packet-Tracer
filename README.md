MAM is the monetary authority of our country. It is led by the management office, and it has several key
divisions (refer to the below table) which are based in the head office or branches (Labuan (LB), Kuching
(KC)). Besides that, it also setup its investment and business units in overseas, i.e. Beijing (BJ), New York
(NY), and Paris (PS). Currently, the total number of staff in the authority is 310. Each group must design and 
implement the network, and validate using Packet Tracer and also provide justification for the IP addressing 
format, IPv4 routing, network topology, cables types etc. Use VLSM to do subnetting.
